## Colour distinction sucks.

Imagine living your life not being able to tell apart red and green. Or red and blue. Or [any colour] and [any other colour].

Now, you're playing a game and suddenly you need to choose the red door! No, the blue button! ðŸ˜µ

Sure, you could add some accessibility option in a buried menu somewhere. Maybe it slaps some quick-and-dirty text on your most problematic items.

## Your players deserve better than that.

It's high time we build with accessibility as a default consideration. Settings are good, but not needing them is better.

That's why I wanted to build something different for [Lua Learning](https://twitter.com/LuaLearning). I wanted to handcraft a set of fun, distinctive textures and icons to cover our colour-coded items in, and I wanted them to be not just functional, but appealing enough that we can use them by default for everyone.

They're designed to be identifiable even when cropped, rotated and shrunk down small. They aren't your typical regime of boring stripes and chequerboards either; drawing from inspirations like ocean waves, ice crystals, starry skies and dragon scales, the patterns are quirky, interesting and distinct from each other, while occasionally evoking a real world thing. They're the perfect differentiating cue for those who need it, and a fun decoration for everyone!

They were perfect for Lua Learning, but as part of our continuing commitment to help more people build great stuff, we wanted to give them to you too. No strings attached, no credit necessary. Just go out there and make the world a more fun, accessible place <3

Thank you to Zack for wholeheartedly supporting the release of these textures! It's a small contribution to the wider world, but nonetheless one I'm very grateful to be able to do!
